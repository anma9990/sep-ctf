Write a python (client) script that connects to server hosted on another machine (puzzle1_server)

IP: 172.16.10.30
PORT: 4444

Server sends message upon connection, then waits to receive from client

NOTE: Server reruns every 30 seconds due to instability
      Don't send an empty string by hitting enter after connection, a read of 0 bytes tells server to shut down
      If you do, server should restart after 30 seconds
