How to make French press coffee
Got your required equipment? Let’s make French press coffee! This coffee method is extremely forgiving. The basic steps? Add the coffee, wait for 5 minutes, and plunge. Here’s what to do:
1. Grind the coffee: Grind 70 grams (1 cup) coffee beans to a medium grind. The size of grind is important: if it’s too fine it can create sediment; if it’s too coarse it’s not flavorful enough.
2. Heat the water: Heat 4 cups water to hot but not boiling (200 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit) using an electric kettle, or bring it to a boil on the stovetop and then let it sit for 1 minute to decrease in temperature.
3. Add coffee grounds: Add the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pot.
4. Let coffee bloom for 1 minute: Add hot water to the height of the coffee and stir with a spoon. Set a timer and wait for 1 minute.
5. Add water and brew 4 minutes: Fill the French press to the top (just below the spout) and stir again. Set a timer and wait for 4 minutes.
6. Plunge: Place the lid on the French press and slowly press the plunger all the way down. Serve immediately. (Tip: If the plunger is hard to press, use a more coarse grind of coffee the next time. If it presses very easily, make the coffee grounds a bit finer.)
