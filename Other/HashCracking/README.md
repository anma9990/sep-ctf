The flag is found by cracking each of the hashes listed in the CrackMe.txt file (or index.html) and combining each result.

This challenge can be further improved by using different hashing algorithms, salts, and otherwise forcing the solver to use specific cracking tools / methods.
Ex: Salting all of the hashes to make rainbow tables unavailable, and giving the salt to the solver as an input into their tool of choice.
