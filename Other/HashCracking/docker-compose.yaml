version: "1" # optional/arbitrary version number, for use by challenge author
services: # these services/boxes make up your challenge.  there may be only one.
  web: # you can probably name this whatever?
    build: webserver # looks for this directory and builds the docker container within.  you could also do . for current directory
    ports: # set up one or more port translation/mappings here.  public -> container
      - "8000:8000" # really, if we're running multiple challenges on a single VPS we'll need to go through each docker-compose.yaml and make sure each is using and different public port.  but that's easy enough
